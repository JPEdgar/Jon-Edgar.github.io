      <p>
        I'm a self-taught programmer with a bachelor's degree in entertainment
        and game design. When the economy receded in 2008, I started my own
        company focused on mobile game design and prototype development using
        Unity and JavaScript. Unfortunately, the artists that agreed to work on
        the graphical assets bailed, and the company went out of business before
        releasing any titles.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the closure of my company, I went on a programming hiatus. I picked
        up programming once more in August 2020, relearning best practices and
        getting back into the mindset of a once-aspiring programmer/developer.

        My pastime includes (but not limited to) writing novels. I'm a published
        author of multiple books, and I'm building my website for professional
        use.
