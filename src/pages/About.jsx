        I'm a self-taught programmer with a Bachelor's degree in Entertainment
        and Game Design. When the economy receded in 2008, I started my own
        company focused on mobile game design and prototype development.
        Unfortunately, the artists that agreed to work on the graphical assets
        bailed, and the company went out of business before releasing any
        titles.

        With the closure of my company, I went on a programming hiatus. I picked
        up programming once more in August 2020, relearning best practices and
        getting back into the mindset of a once-aspiring programmer/developer.

        My pastime includes writing novels. I'm a published author of multiple
        books, and I'm building my website for professional use.
