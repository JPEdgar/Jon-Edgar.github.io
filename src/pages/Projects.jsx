      <p>
        JPEdgar.com is my author website. This project was designed initially
        with templates from webs.com, but I've been working on redesigning this
        project for front-end and back-end development.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project utilizes front-end and back-end development with
        authentication for blog control.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website is written in Javascript using React, React Router, React
        Bootstrap, Bootstrap Social, JSON server, font-awesome, and editor.js.
