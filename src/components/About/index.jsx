      <p>
        I'm a self-taught programmer with a bachelor's degree in entertainment
        and game design. When the economy receded in 2008, I started my own
        company focused on mobile game design and prototype development using
        Unity and JavaScript. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to secure any
        artists, and the company went out of business before releasing any
        titles.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the closure of my company, I went on a programming hiatus. I picked
        up programming once more in August 2020, relearning best practices and
        getting back into the mindset of a once-aspiring programmer/developer.

        My pastime includes (but not limited to) writing novels. I'm a published
        author of multiple books, and I'm building my website for professional
        use.
